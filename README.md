## KondoRobot
My master's thesis was to upgrade the original Kondo robot platform with a new, stronger, controller. The most important new feature of the upgraded platform is probably the addition of a sensory system. This has opened up a whole range of possibilities for Kondo, such as interacting with, and adapting to an unstructured environment. The sensory system has also been important for the creation of the fall recovery procedure.

RM board has a ARM-920T core processor and a customized Linux (Kernel 2.6 series). It can drive up to 24ch RC servos and up to 8ch ADC. It is also equipped with LAN, USB2.0 and FPU.
